## Cloning Down the Repo
Please note that both the .NET SDK (`dotnet`) and NodeJS (`npm`) are required to run this locally on your machine.

You can refer to the resource below or my [repo](https://github.com/tomtom28/hello-unix) on installation to a Mac.

Once this repo is cloned down to your machine, please `cd` into the directory. 

- Then run `dotnet restore` and `npm install` to download the dependencies
- Then convert the typescript to javascript via `webpack`
- Then perform `dotnet run` to serve the webapp.
